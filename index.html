    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Zekai Zhao</strong>, a second-year PhD student at <strong>University of California San Diego (UCSD)</strong>. My work focuses on <strong>causal discovery</strong> and <strong>deep learning</strong> â€” two fields that fascinate me for their potential to uncover the underlying mechanisms of the world and push the boundaries of intelligent systems.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about understanding complex systems and how different elements influence each other. My research aims to answer questions like: <em>How can we identify causal relationships when faced with uncertain or incomplete data?</em> By combining <strong>causal discovery</strong> with the power of <strong>deep learning</strong>, I hope to contribute to a future where our models don't just predict outcomes but also explain why things happen.</p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>In my research, I'm developing tools and methodologies that help identify causal structures within data. This has broad applications, from <strong>healthcare</strong>, where it's vital to understand the root causes of outcomes, to <strong>AI safety</strong>, where making robust decisions requires more than correlation. I'm also diving deep into the realms of <strong>deep learning</strong> to push the effectiveness of neural networks in challenging scenarios.</p>

    <h2>A Bit More About Me</h2>
    <p>Before coming to UCSD, I had rich experiences in both <strong>statistics</strong> and <strong>mathematics</strong>, which laid the foundation for my interest in machine learning and causality. Outside of my research, you can often find me <strong>tutoring</strong>, sharing knowledge with others, or taking a break with a good book.</p>

    <p>Feel free to explore the rest of my website to learn more about my research, publications, and ongoing projects. If you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
